# Translate AI

A production-grade, vision-powered language translation platform built with **Qubrid AI**, **Agno Framework**, and **Streamlit**. This application specializes in extracting text from images through advanced OCR and translating it to 48+ languages using intelligent AI agents.

---

## Problem Statement

Language barriers in visual content present significant challenges across various domains:
- **Travel & Tourism**: Tourists struggle to read foreign signs, menus, and documents
- **Education**: Students need to translate textbook images and handwritten notes
- **Business**: Companies require quick translation of product labels and documents
- **Accessibility**: Non-native speakers face difficulties understanding visual information

Traditional translation workflows are cumbersome:
- Manual text retyping from images is time-consuming and error-prone
- Separate OCR and translation tools create friction in the workflow
- Most solutions lack intelligent language detection
- Poor handling of multilingual or low-quality images

## Solution Overview

To solve this problem, I built a **OCR–Powered Language Translation Platform** that intelligently processes images and delivers accurate translations through a streamlined workflow.

### 1. Vision-Based Text Extraction
Instead of requiring manual text input, the system leverages **Hunyuan OCR 1B**, which is capable of:
- Extracting text directly from images (photos, screenshots, documents)
- Handling various image qualities and formats
- Processing multiple languages and scripts
- Maintaining text structure and formatting

The OCR model processes uploaded images and extracts all readable text, enabling seamless translation without manual transcription.

### 2. Intelligent Language Detection
The system uses an **Agno-powered Language Detection Agent** with GPT-OSS-20B to:
- Automatically identify the source language from extracted text
- Handle multilingual content intelligently
- Provide confidence in language identification
- Support 48+ languages across multiple scripts

This eliminates the need for users to manually specify the source language, streamlining the workflow.

### 3. Agent-Based Translation Pipeline
The translation workflow is orchestrated through **Agno agents**, providing:
- **Streaming responses** for real-time feedback
- **Modular architecture** with separate detection and translation agents
- **Robust error handling** with graceful fallbacks
- **Debug mode** for transparency in AI decision-making

The **Translation Agent** powered by GPT-OSS-20B delivers:
- Context-aware translations preserving meaning and tone
- Support for 48 target languages
- High-quality output for various text types

### 4. Stateless, User-Friendly Design
The application features:
- **Clean UI** with intuitive upload and selection interfaces
- **Real-time processing** with progress indicators
- **Immediate results** showing extracted text, detected language, and translation
- **No persistence overhead** - each translation is independent

## Key Outcomes
- Successfully extracts and translates text from images in a single workflow
- Supports 48+ languages with intelligent auto-detection
- Provides real-time streaming responses for better UX
- Eliminates manual text transcription and language selection
- Built on production-ready Agno framework with Qubrid AI models
